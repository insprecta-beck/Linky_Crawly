# Wordy_Crawly
This is just a basic MS Word doc scraper, that will append hyperlinks to a spreadsheet. The Python script itself is called WordScrape.Py. Input any MS Word .docx or .doc (from your downloads folder), and the output will be a generated list of all the HTTP links (dead or alive) in said document.
